<h2><b> Cloned Repositories Search </b></h2>

To make your GitHub cloned repositories show up in the **Cloned** tree view, you will need to set the **`"git.defaultCloneDirectory"`** in your VSCode `settings.json` to the path your cloned repositories are located (they may be deeply located there).

**1.4.0** - there is now a button to set this config interactively!

<h2><b> Creating a repository </b></h2>

By hovering the **REPOSITORIES** tree view title, a **+** button appears. Click on it, enter the new repository name, description (optional) and visibility. On success, you may choose to clone the new repository.

If you are a member of at least one organization that allows you to create repositories for it, it will be asked, before the repository name input, to pick the new repository owner: your own account or one of those organizations.

<h1 align="center"> Settings </h1>

- ### Always Clone To Default Directory

##### _"githubRepositoryManager.alwaysCloneToDefaultDirectory"_

Always clone to the directory specified in "git.defaultCloneDirectory".

##### Default: **false**

- ## Default Clone Directory Maximum Depth

##### _"githubRepositoryManager.clonedRepositoriesSearch.defaultCloneDirectoryMaximumDepth"_

How deep on `"git.defaultCloneDirectory"` the cloned repositories will be searched. A depth of 0 means it will only search in the directory itself, a depth of 3 means it will search up to 3 directories below. The lesser the faster.

##### Default: **2**

- ## Directories To Ignore

##### _"githubRepositoryManager.clonedRepositoriesSearch.directoriesToIgnore"_

Directories names that are ignored on the search for the cloned repositories. `**/` is added to their start.

##### Default: **["node_modules", ".vscode", ".git/*", "logs", "src", "lib", "out", "build"]**

<h1 align="center"> Roadmap </h1>

- Search and clone public repositories

- Visualize without cloning (useful for getting some value or checking something from some repository)

- "Order by" (alphabetically, stars, your open frequency, created on, updated on) in top menu

- Search repository by name

- Fetch repositories on demand - Some devs have hundreds or thousands of repos. Instead of fetching all of them on init and displaying all of them together, there could be a \[1..100\], \[101, 200\] tree system, for both on demand fetch and display.

For developing: clone it, run `npm i`, `npm start` and run the debugger.
